        <h3>Washing</h3>
            <p> 
                Washing is a technique that involves highlighting shadows by allowing a thin mixture of color that is darker than our base color to flow into the cracks, creases, and crevices of the figure.
            </p>
            <p>
                If brushed over the entire area, the color will flow off of the higher surfaces and stay in the cracks.
            </p>  
            <p>
                If using paint, you will mix some of the base color with a bit of a darker color, making a shadow version of the original.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some use straight black for this, but a darker version of your base color will give a more natural look.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you get a dark color that you are happy with, add some water to the paint by dipping your brush into your rinse container and mixing it with the paint. The consistency that you are after is that of milk. It should flow well and be fairly watery and transparent.
            </p>
          <h3>Technique for Applying Wash</h3>
            <p> 
                Drag your brush loaded with the watery paint ACROSS the grain of whatever you are washing. In other words, you do not want to drag the brush down, say the length of a fold in a cloak, but rather drag it across the folds.
            </p>
            <p>
                This deposits the wash only in the cracks and depressions. If you got uneven amounts of wash, you can put a bit more wash in these areas before it dries, but you'll have more control over you washes if you use a few layers, rather than applying a heavy wash with a fully loaded brush. If you have too much wash on your brush, it's hard to control, and will tend to end up in places you don't want it.
            </p>
          <h3>Painter's Secret</h3>
            <p> 
                Wet a brush and "paint" water over the areas you want to wash. Then apply the wash in smaller, less diluted quanties. The wash will flow over the wet areas easily. With some practice, you can use this technique to wash just the areas you want. If you get water where you don't want it, you're not going to ruin the nearby painted areas. Just let it dry. Then re-paint the area with water. When only the portion of the miniature you want to wash is damp, apply wash.
            <p>
          <h3>Control the Flow of Wash with Gravity</h3>
            <p> 
                It is important to consider how the figure is positioned when applying a wash. Gravity pulls the wash to the lowest point, so you would not want to, for example, stand a figure upright and then wash his cloak unless you want much darker wash near the bottom where it will flow to. Let the figure set in the desired position until the wash is dry enough not to flow. You can then go on to another section of the figure.
            </p>
            <p>
                You cannot wash an entire figure at once due to the way that the wash will flow. Instead do it in sections, even if all that you are washing is the same color. You'll find that you have far more control over how the wash is applied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do this for each area, noting the highlights that will really make the details of the piece stand out. It is amazing how good of detail that you can get out of washing in a minimum of time.
